    The Impact of Social Media on K-POP Globalisation
  </h1>

  <div id='intro_paragraph' class="intro_paragraph_container">
    <p>Over the past 20 years, the music industry has witnessed significant changes, 
      especially within the realm of K-pop. How did K-pop manage to evolve from a niche 
      music market to a major global force?<br>
      <br>
      In 2012, the music video for "Gangnam Style" was uploaded to YouTube and garnered 
      approximately 500,000 views on its first day (Walfisz, 2023). Particularly, Psy's entertaining 
      dance captured significant attention, prompting people to rapidly share this amusing content 
      through social media. As a result of this viral phenomenon, the music quickly gained worldwide 
      popularity, signalling the onset of K-pop's global expansion.<br>
      <br>
      In response to this trend, K-pop 
      companies actively began leveraging social media platforms such as YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram 
      as integral components of their marketing strategies (Cai, 2021b). Social media enabled direct 
      communication between artists and fans, with artists utilising these platforms for daily updates, 
      behind-the-scenes insights, and interactive engagement (the Harvard Crimson, 2013). Furthermore, 
      fans extensively utilised social media, fostering a sense of community and emerging as staunch 
      supporters of their favourite K-pop artists.<br>
      <br>
      Consequently, K-pop transcended traditional boundaries 
      with the advent of social media. In the era of the digital revolution, where content dissemination 
      became more accessible, social media platforms emerged as indispensable tools for facilitating cultural 
      exchange, thereby playing a pivotal role in expanding the influence of K-pop beyond geographical 
      constraints (Writer, 2023c).

      <p>Examining the comprehensive web search data reveals a remarkable increase in the global prominence of

        In contrast to the past, where traditional mediums such as television and radio held sway, today, 
        the rise of social media platforms as central hubs for music exploration and fan interaction is undeniable.

  <div id='chart2_paragraph'>
    <p>YouTube, the world's second most popular search engine after Google, stands as the ultimate social media 
      platform for connecting with a global audience. Entertainment serves as a primary driver for its widespread
      usage, with roughly 96% of internet users across approximately 100 countries actively engaging with its content (Blogger, 2024). 
      Notably, K-pop transcends geographical barriers, garnering significant viewership even in far-flung corners 
      of the globe, a testament to its universal appeal.

  <div id='chart3_paragraph'>
    <p>Since its entry into the US market in 2009 and its subsequent rise on the Billboard charts, K-pop was still 
      largely considered a niche genre on a global scale. However, in 2012, Psy's "Gangnam Style" became a sensation 
      on YouTube, marking the beginning of increased global awareness of K-pop. Then, in 2017, with BTS's breakthrough 
      in the United States, K-pop's popularity became undeniable on the Billboard charts. In comparison to the past, 
      many K-pop artists are now making significant strides on the Billboard charts, and through various social media 
      platforms, K-pop's visibility has been globalised, spearheaded by YouTube.

  <div id='chart4_paragraph'>
    <p>Before the advent of social media platforms, people depended solely on television, radio, or word of mouth to 
      assess an artist's popularity. However, in today's era, with the rapid surge in social media usage, it has become 
      possible to gauge popularity through search terms on social media platforms. In 2022, BTS was notably mentioned more 
      frequently than other artists across three social media platforms: Twitter, Tumblr, and Reddit.

      interactions and understanding. Through the power of social media, K-pop has transcended geographic boundaries, 
      captivating audiences around the world, and helped create a sense of unity and belonging among fans across continents.<br>
      By showcasing how K-pop used social media to become a successful global phenomenon, we were able to confirm that people 
      can have a positive influence by breaking down boundaries and sharing something even in different environments and cultures. 
      As such, we must leverage social media as a positive tool, harnessing its power to spread joy, interconnectedness and
